- README.md

# Building the Project

Renderer uses sdl, a c compiler, and make.
So, you need to have all of these on your machine.
Also, you will need the sdl libraries in your `PATH`
in order for make to find them.

If you have all of that, you should be able to type `make`
to build the project into a final executable, that's all.
